1. Draw the body as flowersack to get the sense of twist and turns.
2. Avoid using convex shapes because they are really boring and they look like shit. Make them little bit of exciting by staggering them.

   like make one side curve and other side linear. Instead of making them smooth, try to make them little bit of sharper. So instead of being a smooth curve for the calf, we will add a sharp point for it.

  ex. look at the shape for the leg, it's so weird. We got the staggering shape for the calf and sharp shape for ankle bone. This is kind of thing you learn by studyng other artists. Bony areas like hands and elbows, we're gonna use sharper shapes.

Sometimes, the shape of body (arm/leg) might feel smooth and you might end up drawing them with curves without any staggering points. But you should draw those shapes with blocky shapes and points :

Back tilt of torso and pelvis is very important, it make the pose feels natural, even in straight standing poses :
